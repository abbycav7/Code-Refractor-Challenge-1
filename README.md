# Horiseon: Online Solutions (Challenge-1)

## Description 

This week I was challenged with refactoring existing code to bring it up to a more accessible standard by using HTML, CSS and Git.

While updating the site I found a broken link in the code (more specifically with the Social Media Marketing tab) that I tweaked, as well as images that did not contain alt tags for accessibility, which I made sure to add.

I found that our page was not consistent on all screens, so I spent some time making sure that our site would be ready and accessible for mobile screens as well as your computer screen.

Overall this was a fun project and really helped show me first hand the importance of clean code.
